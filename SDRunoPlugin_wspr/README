	(experimental) wspr plugin (most likely not ready for use)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In wspr mode, the transmitter transmits - starting on the even minutes -
a smallband signal, usually pretty weak, for about 113 seconds.
(Of course the next minute will be even again, and a new message can
be sent.

The signal itself has a bandwidth of app 6 Hz, with frequency shifts of
about 1.45 Hz.
Decoding is tough, happily there is a ready-made set of functions that
will do the hard work (wsprd). It must be stressed that the copyrights for those
functions belongs to **Joe Taylor and Steven Franke **, and those functions
are included integrally in the code for this plugin.

The function of the plugin front end is then limited to
 a. ensuring that reading in samples starts at even minutes;
 b. input filtering, collecing and decimation. The final decimation
is to 375 samples/second (We start here with 192000, the SDRplay will send
2000000 Samples/second to the SDRuno framewirk).
c, handling the result.

The FFT handling is modified, rather than the FFTW3 library, a choice
was made to use the KISS library, primarily since the sources could be
included, preventing potential users to oblige installing yet another 
library.
The copyrights of the KISS library belong to  Mark Borgerding and
are gratefully acknowledged.

The basic idea is that since reading in the samples takes about 116 seconds, 
there is ample time to do the processing in parallel.
In the Linux version decoding is dome by firing a single thread in which
the function is executed.
