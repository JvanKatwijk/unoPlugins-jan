Important note
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The plugins in the directory are tested on my W10 box with SDRuno and
they work fine - again - on my W10 box.
Knowing windows, it is not ruled out that on YOUR system the plugin
does not work correctly.
While that mught be disappointing, note that the plugins are 
made available "as is", the license clearly states
