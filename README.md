Based on user's request, the FT8 plugin now has a selector for filtering
the output to "just" CQ's.

*************BEFORE YOU START READ THE DOCUMENTATION***************

To ease installation, I put ALL dll's required for some of the
plugins into a folder "required dll".

Install these dll's to an appropriate place on your system, e.g.
C:\Program Files(x86)\SDRplay\SDRuno

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Important note
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The plugins in the directory are tested on my W10 box with SDRuno and
they work fine - again - on my W10 box.
Knowing windows, it is not ruled out that on YOUR system the plugin
does not work correctly.
While that mught be disappointing, note that the plugins are 
made available "as is", the license clearly states
